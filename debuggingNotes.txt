doesn't work for this right now, profile_scraper works but when p.currentJob list is passed to scrap_profiles, it is only 1 item, therefore cant go thru this loop:
for current_job in p.current_job:
            if x < 4:
                data.append(current_job.company.name)
                data.append(current_job.position)
                if current_job.location == None:
                    data.append(None)
                    data.append(None)
                else:
                    data.append(current_job.location.city)
                    data.append(current_job.location.country)
                x += 1
